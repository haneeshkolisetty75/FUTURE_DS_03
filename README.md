📊 Student Feedback Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes student feedback survey data to understand overall satisfaction, identify strengths and weaknesses in teaching and course structure, and provide data-driven insights for improvement.

Using Python and data analysis techniques, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), satisfaction scoring, and visualization of feedback trends.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains student feedback ratings across multiple evaluation criteria such as:

Subject knowledge of the instructor

Clarity of explanation

Use of presentations

Assignment difficulty

Doubt-solving ability

Course structure

Support provided to students

Course recommendation relevance

Each row represents feedback from one student.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab

GitHub

🔍 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Inspected the data structure and columns.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., index columns).

Converted rating columns to numeric values.

Handled missing values.

Standardized column names.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated descriptive statistics.

Analyzed distribution of ratings.

Visualized overall satisfaction using histograms.

4️⃣ Satisfaction Analysis

Calculated overall satisfaction score for each student.

Computed average rating for each feedback question.

Visualized average ratings using bar charts.

5️⃣ Sentiment Analysis

Categorized students into Positive, Neutral, and Negative satisfaction groups based on their overall ratings.

Visualized sentiment distribution.

6️⃣ Insights & Recommendations

Identified strong and weak areas in teaching and course design.

Suggested actionable improvements based on data.

📈 Key Insights

Most students provided positive feedback overall.

Subject knowledge and explanation clarity received higher ratings.

Assignment difficulty and course structure showed relatively lower ratings.

There is scope to improve engagement and course organization.

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to interpret student feedback and support data-driven decision-making in educational environments. The insights obtained can help institutions improve teaching quality and student satisfaction.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add advanced sentiment analysis using NLP on textual feedback.

Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI / Tableau / Streamlit.

Compare feedback across different courses or semesters.
